 Group Assignment

 We have chosen the following Task F - Flowers Recognition, for which we would be using 3 pre-trained 
models and experimenting with different modifications to each of them. Each of these models would 
have three baselines to compare our modifications to. These baselines include: 
1)  Freezing the whole architecture and training only the last layer (Frozen). 
2)  Training the entire original architecture with pre-trained weights (Unfrozen). 
3)  Training the triplet loss of the model (Triplet Loss).

The 3 models and their modifications are as follows: 
1)  EfficientNet - Architecture Modification 
2)  ResNet  - Loss Function Modification 
3)  Vision Transformer  - Loss Function modification
